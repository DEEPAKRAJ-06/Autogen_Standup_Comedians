      "\n",
      "But in India, it‚Äôs reversed! The parents meet first. If they agree you‚Äôre compatible on paper ‚Äì same caste, similar income bracket, both can hold a chai cup without spilling ‚Äì *then* they present you with your potential spouse. It's like, \"Here! This is your life partner. Figure it out.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It‚Äôs basically like buying a house. You look at the location, the price, the number of bathrooms... you're not really concerned about if the house is going to tell you you're not emotionally available.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the best part? The biodatas. Oh my god, the biodatas. It's like Tinder meets LinkedIn, but with way more pressure. \"Looking for a fair, slim, convent-educated girl, preferably with excellent cooking skills and a willingness to relocate.\" Relocate where? To your kitchen? (Mimics stirring an imaginary pot) \"Looking for a boy who is well-settled and earning six figures, owns his own apartment, and doesn't snore loudly.\" Good luck finding that, Auntie!\n",
      "\n",
      "And then the arranged marriage meetings themselves... it's like a job interview where the stakes are your entire life. You're sitting across from a complete stranger, desperately trying to prove that you're worthy of them, while their parents are silently judging your every move.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember one meeting I had where I was asked, very seriously, if I could prepare a ‚Äúfull North Indian meal.‚Äù I almost choked on my chai. I mean, I can barely make Maggi without setting off the smoke alarm, but sure, I'm gonna whip up a feast worthy of a Michelin star for someone I just met.\n",

      "Cathy, \"crippling anxiety masked by self-deprecating humor\" ‚Äì that's my demographic in a nutshell! You nailed it! Yeah, I just escaped a Zoom meeting with my agent. He kept saying \"synergy\" and \"reach\" and I kept nodding and thinking about what I'm gonna have for dinner. Honestly, a microwave burrito sounds way more appealing than leveraging my brand.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you‚Äôre right, I‚Äôm not on TikTok. I tried it once. I spent three hours trying to learn a dance and ended up pulling a hamstring. Now I just yell at clouds and tell kids to get off my lawn‚Ä¶ which, admittedly, I don't have a lawn. I live in a one-bedroom apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "What‚Äôs keeping me entertained? Lately, it's been watching squirrels try to figure out bird feeders. It's like a tiny, furry heist movie, but with acorns instead of diamonds. I swear, one of these days, they're gonna crack the code and I'll have to start paying them rent. They're more resourceful than my agent, I'll tell you that.\n",

You're practically writing my next act right now! Seriously, if you see a squirrel using a tiny crowbar, you call me immediately. We're going viral!\n",
      "\n",
      "My anxiety coping mechanism? Oh, where do I even begin? Besides comedy, it involves a carefully curated playlist of whale song, a weighted blanket that makes me feel like I'm being gently suffocated, and a subscription to a magazine about miniature dollhouses. Don't judge! Building a tiny, perfect world where everything is in my control is the perfect antidote to the giant dumpster fire that is reality.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, Joe, tell me, what kind of burrito are we talking? Beef? Bean? Or are you feeling adventurous and going with the \"mystery meat surprise\"? Because if it's the latter, you might need a stronger anxiety coping mechanism than whale song.\n",

Turns out, comedy isn't the *most* stressful thing I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you're absolutely right about \"leveraging my brand.\" I'm pretty sure my brand is just \"Slightly Overweight Guy Tells Jokes,\" so the opportunities are limited. Unless Frito-Lay wants to sponsor me. I'd sell out for a lifetime supply of Doritos.\n",
      "\n",
      "The burrito? Okay, so I was thinking beef, but the \"mystery meat surprise\" at the corner store is looking dangerously tempting. It's probably just refried beans dyed a weird color, but the gamble is part of the appeal, isn't it? It's like Russian roulette, but with indigestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, you know what would be great? A miniature dollhouse...themed like a dive bar. Tiny little sticky tables, a miniature pool table with a missing leg, and a little cardboard cutout of me telling jokes to empty chairs. I think you're onto something with this dollhouse thing, Cathy. This could be our new act! We build miniature worlds that reflect the absurdity of our real ones. We could call it... *The Dollhouse of Despair!*\n",

      "\n",
      "Okay, \"Russian roulette with indigestion\" is the PERFECT way to describe that burrito. I'm stealing that. And the \"Dollhouse of Despair\"? Genius! We'll have tiny, broken dreams piled in the corner, a miniature therapist's office with a never-ending waiting list, and a tiny bar with miniature watered-down drinks and a perpetually depressed bartender. We're gonna be rich! ... Or at least have a really interesting Etsy store.\n",
